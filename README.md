#SURGE Hackathon Event 

A demonstration of reading EEG brainwave data, and processing for real-world applications. 
This project is a short proof-of-concept for processing and classifying motor cortex activation response based on EEG sensor data in real time, and applying it for therapeutic stroke rehabilitation. 
The classifier labels are intended to be used for auditory feedback based on if each data epoch is classified as movement or resting state.
